Secondly, they need to be hardworking and show dedication to their work or cause. Vietnamese people especially respect those who have overcome difficulties through perseverance and stayed humble despite their success. Additionally, being family-oriented and respecting traditional values is highly valued. Finally, contributing to society, whether through charity work or helping others, is seen as a mark of a true role model."

Their actions and words can significantly influence people, particularly young and impressionable fans.

            "The concept of role models has changed quite dramatically over the years. In the past, role models were typically historical figures, political leaders, or local community members like teachers and doctors. Today, with the rise of social media and the entertainment industry, many young people look up to celebrities, influencers, and YouTube stars. The criteria have also shifted - it's now often about success, wealth, and fame rather than moral character or contribution to society. Additionally, role models have become more accessible through social media, but this also means their flaws and mistakes are more visible. I think this change reflects broader societal shifts in values and how we communicate."

Parents should also provide guidance while allowing children to make their own decisions and learn from mistakes. Creating a supportive environment where children feel safe to express themselves is crucial. Additionally, encouraging education, teaching respect for others, and exposing children to diverse experiences can broaden their perspectives. Finally, spending quality time together and having open conversations helps build strong relationships and trust."
